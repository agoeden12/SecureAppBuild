# CHANGES ----------------
#   removed the request to the getBibleVerse(x,y,z) method because it wouldn't run when the button was clicked, leading to the label not displaying properly
#
#   removed the global x, y, and z variables because they were not being used as global variables, they were only seen inside the local scope of the methods
#
#   moved the getBibleVerse(x,y,z) method to be called from within the howDoYouFeel method that way instead of returning x,y,z to nothing it can just pass the variables in directly
